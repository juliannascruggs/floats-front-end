			<h3>Pay Attention & Carry Mace</h3>
			<p><!-- Criminal violence against women occurs in broad daylight. Total strangers follow women into their homes and rape them. This shit happens, and we don't want it to happen to us. If becoming a victim is simply not an option for you, you need a personal safety plan.  -->I was attacked in broad daylight when leaving work, alone. Incidents like this are uncommon but not unheard of, and mine was far from the worst of it's kind. After the attack, Police came to my work to give a talk on personal safety. They described each stage of the incident, and all the signs that I failed to recognize, as though they had been there. The officers had no knowledge of the specifics of my attack, but they have been there themselves on a different street corner with a different criminal. They told us how to recognize the stages leading up to an attack like this, and how we absolutely can protect ourselves. It boils down to paying attention and using mace.</p>

				<h4>How to Carry Mace</h4>

				<p>In the event of my attack, pepper spray should have been my first line of defense. When that moment came, I did not have mace in my hand. It was broad daylight ///////. Becoming a victim again is simply not an option for me. This requires preparation so that I have mace on hand at all times.<br /><br />

				Making my personal safety plan a reality requires a self defense strategy. I need a type of mace that I feel safe using. I carry pepper spray gel, but keep a spray on hand during the heavy rain season. When I change my purse, I have to where I will store my mace, and where I would need to reach for it if it's not in my hand.<br /><br />

				<!--Think of the last time you went rifling through your purse for a pen. If your mace is in the bottom of your purse in the event that you need it, it's about as useful as that pen. 

				Solve for the practical reasons why your pepper spray ends up in the bottom of your purse or closet.

				Keychain mace should be small but easy to grab, with a safety that you can operate without looking at it. What if you don't carry your keys when you walk alone? Remember, you have to literally carry mace in your hand for it to be effective. If clenching your hot pink mace in your fist everywhere you go makes you feel like a paranoid weirdo, find something discreet that you can passively carry. Runners mace is a comfortable and discreet size and the handstrap allows you to carry it passively. </br></br>
 				Fake lipstick and pen pepper spray are both destined for the bottom of your day bag. But let's face it, the popular breast cancer keychain mace is an unlikely candidate to be stuffed into your tiny clutch on a night out on the town.  --></p>
